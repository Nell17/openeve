#summary Recovery Mode

CyanogenMod 7.0 support clockwork recovery.img

GW620/KH5200 does not support a recovery partion but anyway you can use it with fastboot *boot* command like as
{{{
fastboot boot my-recovery.img
}}}

== Recovery mode ==
 # download *gb-recovery.img*
 # `fastboot.exe` *boot* `gb-recovery.img` (not `fastboot.exe` *flash* `boot` ...)

== mount USB storage and install *.zip ==
 # mount sdcard
 # copy *.zip (a undate.zip style file) into sdcard
  # you have to install boot*.zip under RecoveryMode
  # you can also install gapps-gb-*zip under RecoveryMode

== Clockwork Recovery ==
